A conference I went to earlier in the year got me thinking about the phrase, "Change your company or change your company".
I've seen this phrase littered across the technology world, frequently used by great but frustrated engineers, fast learners, over achievers and also people who are frankly too big for their boots.

this phrase is to me is an obvious sign of dissonance between a worker and their employer, and in a lot of cases can be accepted as quite reasonable. 
However I fear there is a trend and a acceptance among engineers now that if your company isn't using the latests and greatest application stack, or configuration tools 
or potentially lacks in its processes that it is an obvious sign to up and leave moving onto the next great adventure. 

# I might know someone who would disagree. 

If you've ever studied ancient Greek philosophy you might of come across a couple of well known characters called Plato and Socrates. These guys were pretty renown for their thoughts on how the world worked,
but also about political systems and ideas of how society should be ran. Persoanlly I think they have some spot on points (leaving aside the salvery and other archaic traditions.) 

In the book the Republic theres an allegory called the cave. [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTWwY8Ok5I0)
